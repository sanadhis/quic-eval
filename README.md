# quic-eval
This project aims to analyze, benchmark, and elicit interesting features and performance of Google's QUIC protocol. This corresponds to **Master Project** conducted by myself on behalf of **DSCL** at EPFL.

# About QUIC
QUIC is an encrpyted (TLS 1.3, IETF standardization), multiplexed (single connection, multiple streams), and low-latency (0-RTT handshake, connection establishment) application-layer transport protocol over UDP, designed to improve HTTPS performance for secured web traffic. QUIC compromises reliable, secured, and TCP-friendly protocol. 

# Limitations
The open-source implementation of QUIC in Chromium project is not tuned for production-level performance. There may also be a gap between what is publicly released by Chromium project and what Google actually has in production.

# Exploration of Google's QUIC
TBD

# Official Documentation
