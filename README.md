# quic-eval
This project aims to analyze, benchmark, and elicit interesting features and performance of Google's QUIC protocol. This corresponds to **Master Project** conducted by myself on behalf of **DSCL** at EPFL.

# About Quic
Quic is an encrpyted (TLS 1.3, IETF standardization), multiplexed (single connection, multiple streams), and low-latency (0-RTT handshake, connection establishment) application-layer transport protocol over UDP, designed to improve HTTPS performance for secured web traffic. Quic compromises reliable, secured, and TCP-friendly protocol.
